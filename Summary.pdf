Cloud Storage: I chose to store objects due to their simplicity, scalability, and low-latency access. It's also the most cost-effective storage for this use case.

Cloud Functions are ideal for event-driven, serverless computing. They are suited for short-lived, stateless functions triggered by events like Pub/Sub messages or HTTP/s requests. They do not require a VM so that costs can be low.

Cloud Pub/Sub: Chosen for its ability to trigger the cloud function when needed. Also, its integration with the Google Cloud Scheduler provides reliable and scalable messaging.

Cloud Scheduler: I Chose this to trigger Pub/Sub, providing a fully managed cron job service to invoke the function once every 10 minutes. It is integrated into the GCP console and is fully managed and secure. 

        Cloud Storage costs scale with the amount of data stored and operations performed.
        Cloud Function costs are based on the number of function invocations and resource usage during execution.
        Cloud Pub/Sub costs depend on the volume of messages published and consumed.
        Cloud Scheduler costs are based on the number of job executions.

The Costs for Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud Scheduler stay relatively the same as traffic increases because regardless of traffic increase, 
            GCP Cloud scheduler is still executing once every 10 minutes
            Pub/Sub is still sending one message every 10 minutes

For Cloud Storage, as traffic increases, the bucket may need to be multi-regional and served through a content delivery network depending on the traffic source to reduce the latency to users accessing the endpoint. This addition will increase the cost of the implementation.
    
As for cloud functions, Google Cloud Functions is designed to scale automatically based on the number of incoming events or invocations. So, as traffic increases, Cloud Functions can automatically add new instances to handle the invocations coming from the HTTP requests. This will lead to increased costs but will ensure availability for the endpoint.

Then, networking costs, egress specifically, will increase as network costs are incurred from accessing the multi-region buckets.
       
This implementation leverages built-in monitoring features of individual services. Also, it uses cloud monitoring dashboards and alerts for key performance indicators (KPIs), such as when the rate limit is exceeded. It also utilizes Cloud Logging for collecting and analyzing logs, including Cloud Functions logs.
    

This solution can help recover from a regional disaster by having the same implementation deployed with Terraform in a different region. Then, an application load balancer can be placed in front of the HTTP endpoint to redirect traffic to the healthy endpoint via a health check. My implementation will require redeployment in a different region to save on costs within my personal project. If there is an outage, it will impact the users' access for about 1-2 minutes while the cloud resources are being deployed in a different region.


This implementation follows the principles of:
        Operational excellence, as it is efficiently deployed, operated, and managed using Infrastructure as Code methodologies to reduce human errors, can be fully monitored.

        Security, privacy, and compliance: This implementation is secure as only users with assigned permissions can access the resources deployed. The bucket containing the information sent to the endpoint is also encrypted with a CMEK key and a compliance lock of 10 years in the bucket to prevent accidental deletions.

        Reliability: This implementation is reliable as it can be recovered quickly in the event of a disaster. It can easily be made more reliable by using multi-region buckets to protect against outages and a load balancer to failover between two deployments if needed.
        
        Performance optimization: This implementation has been created to be very efficient, striking the right balance between performance and cost optimization. The HTTP cloud function has enough memory headroom for sudden increased invocations, while Cloud Function auto-scales as the traffic scales.
